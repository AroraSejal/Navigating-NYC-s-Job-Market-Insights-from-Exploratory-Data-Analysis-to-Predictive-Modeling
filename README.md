# Navigating-NYC-s-Job-Market-Insights-from-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-to-Predictive-Modeling

This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset containing information about job postings in New York City that includes information like job titles, salary ranges, and job descriptions. By using this dataset, our goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing the salary ranges in NYC.

Dataset: We have selected the " NYC Jobs Postings" dataset, accessible at the following URL: 
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nyc-jobs
This dataset contains current job postings available on the City of New Yorkâ€™s official jobs site (http://www.nyc.gov/html/careers/html/search/search.shtml). Internal postings available to city employees and external postings available to the general public are included.
